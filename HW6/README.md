As part of HW-6 I chose a [VAST](http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2014) and to showcase some of the algorithms,
I chose clustering of news articles. 

The pdf contains the [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/all-the-news-17fa34b52b9d) from which this demo
was inspired and also the [kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news) to the dataset used. 

You can view the html files directly using [Html preview link](http://htmlpreview.github.io/)
