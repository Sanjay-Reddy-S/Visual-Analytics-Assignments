As part of the final project, [VAST 2014](http://www.vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2014) challenge was tackled. 
The aim was to provide generic tools, which would be helpful in providing insights when applied on similar [datasets](http://vast.cs.umass.edu/benchmarks.php) (includes text files like emails, news-articles, GPS coordinates of vehicles (tracked continuously) and the road maps of surrounding city, credit card spendings, streaming micro-blog/Twitter data).

The pdf goes into details of what results were achieved and also possible extensions/various experimentations which were conducted.
